# gamerOS: the definitive couch gaming experience

## What is it?
gamerOS is an experimental installer script that, when run, results in a minimal Arch Linux system capable of playing Steam games in big picture mode out of the box. gamerOS has aspirations to be its own distribution focused exclusively on gaming and can be thought of as an alternative to SteamOS. 

## Features

### easy to install
boot into your new gaming system within minutes (work in progress)

### minimal
only what you need to play games and nothing more

### out of the box
start gaming right away with zero configuration

### always up to date
frequent updates delivering the latest drivers and software for an optimal experience

### seamless updates
fully automatic updates that run in the background without disrupting gameplay (work in progress)

### controller first
fully controller compatible interface with no mouse or keyboard required (but you can still use a mouse and keyboard if you like)

### use any controller
support for Xbox 360, Xbox One, DualShock 4, Switch Pro, Steam controllers and more (game dependent)

### play any game
out of the box support for playing NES, SNES, Genesis, N64, PlayStation, Wii, Steam, GOG, itch.io games and more (currently only Steam games work out of the box)
